# Google-Trend-for-Loan-Searches

The goal of this analysis is to find seasonality for google searches for keyword loan.
In time series data, seasonality is the presence of variations that occur at specific regular intervals less than a year, such as weekly, monthly, or quarterly.

The result of this analysis can be used to align the timing of marketing campaigns for loan companies to optimize the effectiveness of the campaign. i.e. doing more ads when more people are looking for loans.
